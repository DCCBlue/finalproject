        <p>What makes Valorant a unique tactical shooter is Riot Games' ability to combine the traditional FPS and put a spin on it with unique aspects to the genre. Following a formula from its major competitor "CS:GO", Riot Games' take on tactical shooters cultivated many veteran and new FPS players. The design of the game is built on a solid foundation of FPS fundamentals we love and know, while still including fresh ideas to set itself apart from its competitors. Because of Riot Games' innovative addition to future FPS games and having a notable reputation from their golden children <a href= "https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/">League of Legends</a> and <a href="https://teamfighttactics.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/?utm_medium=card3%2Bwww.leagueoflegends.com&utm_source=riotbar">Teamfight Tactics</a>, Valorant has been able to become a leading FPS game since its release in 2020.</p>

        <p>Whenever I have the choice, I will either play a "<a href="https://valorant.fandom.com/wiki/Agents/Duelists">Duelist</a>" or "<a href="https://valorant.fandom.com/wiki/Agents/Sentinels">Sentinel</a>". I prefer to be flexible and play multiple roles so that way I have an understanding of all Agents in the game. While being a "Flex" player, these are all of the Agents I have had the most fun playing so far!</p>
